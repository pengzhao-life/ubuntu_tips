## Dell G3 laptop recovery for Windows  10
I accidently messed up BIOS, and it didn't boot anymore. After unsuccessfully trying some boot-repair tricks, I decided to reinstall system. Here are the steps for recovering Windows 10 on Dell G3 laptop:
* Reboot computer, and keep tapping F12 to go to BIOS menu
* Select 'Dell Support Recovery Assitant', then select 'Recovery from Cloud' (I tried 'recovery from local', it finished without error but still didn't boot.)
* Then it tried to install Windows 10 from cloud, and restarted a couple times. It came to a stage where it shows both admin and default0 user, which both require password. Select 'reset PC' to remove personal info, and reinstallation started.
